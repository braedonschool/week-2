        <h3>Tips from a pro!</h3>

        <p>Alright, we've all been in that situation before. You've just gotten yourself your first little guy captured free of charge, but now he's contracted the malice, every cat does after its first few weeks with it's new owner. But because of how often I practice this technique, I've come up with a few amazing ways to feed a malice ridden cat!</p>

        <p>Now, a little bit of preperation is required to begin feeding a malice ridden cat, you'll need a few items.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The tongue of the great dragon deity Ok'lagunhg (He feels no pain from its removal)</li>
            <li>Cat food of your choosing.</li>
            <li>A bowl of your choosing (Preferably a breastplate from the armor of a fallen warrior)</li>
            <li>Sports gear (Will be explained shortly)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now, rightfully so you may be overwhelmed with questions as to why you may neew a few of these items. Lets start with in my opinion the least likely one to be on this list, the sports gear. Now, there is a very simply reason for the sports gear, malice ridden cats are possessed by the spirits of long dead Einherji from Valhalla, most of which were incredibly into the sport "Soccer", a british sport bastardized by the Ameriacns a few hundred years after they gained independence. Now, these Einherji spirits love a good game of soccer, and will only agree to leave the spirit of the malice ridden kitty if you beat them in a game, this can prove fatal to the cat however as the spirit will not allow it eat until the game is partook, so you best hurry.</p>

        <p>These Einherji may play themselves as big and tough, unbeatable soccer players, but they only have about 4 play styles which will easily be able to be guessed after their first few moves in the game, each having a fairly obvious counter which I will showcase to assist in your battle to save the cat.</p>
